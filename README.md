# SmugAware

This plugin allows the user to display active flight data received on an ADS-B receiver built to specifications as outlined by flight aware.  Use of this plugin is best with 'Buzztouch' (www.buzztouch.com).

Despite the 'Category' being iOS, there is both iOS and Android code available in the download.

There is a video of the screen 'in action' on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89TiCCz9m3Q
